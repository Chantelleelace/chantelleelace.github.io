# Welcome to my Pro Dev Page

I'll use this space to add my Pro Dev assignments. 

## The week of September 24th, 2018

### Quantitative Accomplishments

Brought $20,000 worth of new clients to company.
Saved company thousands of dollars by implementing new grading scale.
Optimized working functionality and reduced overhead costs by hundreds of dollars. 

### Qualitative Features

Resourceful at finding the most optimal path to a solution; I sometimes think this way is the only correct way of doing said thing. 
Great at selling and marketing new lifestyle changes to clients; I have to really believe in said lifestyle to want to sell to others.
Professional in the working environment; I tend not to create deep bonds with colleagues and keep a strictly professional relationship.

### Passion Projects

I spend most of my time outside of working/school devoted to my two daughters and my family. My goal with them is to, obviously, make sure they are wonderful human beings. I do that by teaching and showing them all of life’s wonders. We’ll look at the sunrise in the morning and talk about how the earth rotates and how the sun gives our sky it’s beautiful color. Or we will interact with our community and try things outside of our comfort zones. When speaking with my daughters, I have to be creative in finding ways to explain basic, everyday things that I would normally overlook. This is what gives me drive to, after they have gone to sleep, work on my logical/work side. 

### Elevator Pitch

Hi my name is Chantelle. I am looking for an amazing job that provides a great work/life balance that I am super passionate about. I went to this coding bootcamp that provided me the skills necessary so that I could provide a better life for me and my family. How does your company see work/life balance?

### Weekly Break Down 

The week overall went really well. Just nervous for the infamous ‘week three break down’ that I’ve been hearing about. I kept up in class following along with Nick and Chris although I know I wouldn’t be able to go and write an app or reconstruct what we just did on my own yet. I’m not sure if that’s where I am supposed to be at quite yet. I have gone back and forth about choosing my app project and have yet decided what I want mine to be. Looking forward to week two!
